     <div class="title"><h1>Beautiful Spain</h1></div>
     <div class="paragraph"><p>It was a beautiful Saturday afternoon and me and my friend Sam were hanging out at some coffee place enjoying each other’s company. Sam and I have been friends since we were about five years old making our bond stronger than any of my other friends. I glanced at him and suddenly thought of a brilliant idea. Spring break was just around the corner and we both love traveling. I told him that I want to go to Italy since I have been interested in the Italian culture for the longest time. I have read a lot about the country, and even tried to learn the language for some time.</p></div>
     <div class="paragraph1"><p>I also love to watch Italian football. However, Sam indicated that he preferred going to Spain. He had a lot of Spanish friends and wanted to know more about the country. After arguing for a while, we decided to check the travel agencies in the area and take the cheapest package for a trip to Spain. This is how my friendship with Sam goes. We both have different opinions and points of view but we try to compromise to be able to decide on things. When we arrived at the travel agency, a crowd of people wanting to book flights for their vacations welcomed us inside. Luckily, there was one available agent at the corner of the office. We approached her and stated that we were planning take a trip to either Spain or Italy for one week and we would prefer to take the cheapest offer.</p></div>

     <div class="paragraph3"><p>After a few minutes of checking their system on the computer, she related that the cheapest flight was to Malaga, which is the capital of Costa del Sol, in the south region of Spain. The package would also come along with a hotel accommodation. This was good news for us and we took the offer without hesitation. The flight to Spain was not until after a few days and I spent those days trying to prepare for the trip. I made a checklist of what I was supposed to bring. I thought very carefully of the clothes and shoes that I would bring. I also made sure that my camera was fully charged. I even did my research about Spain in the Internet. The day of the flight to Spain came quickly. I arrived at the airport at six o’clock in the morning and found Sam waiting for me. He looked slightly annoyed because I was a bit late but I explained that my alarm clock did not go off and apologized for this. I am grateful because Sam is very understanding. If this had been some other person, he or she would not have understood and would not have accepted my apology quickly, since this was an important day for both of us. But it was Sam and this is how he really is and I am glad for this. We were lucky because our flight was delayed. At 7:30 a.m., the airplane took off the airport.</p></div>
